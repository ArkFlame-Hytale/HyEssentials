# HyEssentials v1.0.0
**The Ultimate Essentials Suite for Hytale Servers.**

Developed by **ArkFlame Development**, HyEssentials is a comprehensive, high-performance, and modular essentials plugin designed to bring the familiar power of EssentialsX to the Hytale platform. Built from the ground up with **full async support** and a **modular architecture**, it ensures your server remains lag-free while providing every feature your players expect.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **🛡️ Built-in Permissions:** Robust group-based permission system with wildcards and priority handling.
- **💰 Economy Ready:** Interface-based economy system ready for Vault-style integrations.
- **🏠 Advanced Teleportation:** TPA system with warmups, cooldowns, and movement cancellation.
- **📦 Kit System:** Create kits with cooldowns, prices, and permission-based access.

## 👨‍💻 For Developers

HyEssentials is built for extensibility. You can hook into the module system or implement your own economy provider.

**Example: Checking for Permissions**
```java
if (plugin.getPermissionManager().hasPermission(player.getUuid(), "essentials.fly")) {
    // Logic here
}
```
